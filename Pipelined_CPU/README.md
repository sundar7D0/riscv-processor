Implement a pipelined version of the single-cycle CPU designed in assignment 3. 

Required in submission:

Clear block diagram of the components
Comments and explanation in the Verilog code indicating which part of code corresponds to which part of the diagram
Analysis of the performance: based on synthesis reports, what is the best clock speed at which the system can run
The minimum expectation is functional correctness - all instructions must execute properly. In addition to that, forwarding and hazard detection are also required, but if not fully implemented, there should be explanations of how to get around the problems.

You can work in groups of 2 - report should carry a clear indication of how the work was divided and who did what.

You do NOT need to stick to the 5-stage pipeline discussed in class. Further exploration of options and comparison of possible designs will be considered for extra credit.
