# RISCV-Processor
Verilog code of a RISC-V processor with multi-stage pipelining with BRAM predictor and DMEM delay simulator. Link for RISCV ISA interpretation: https://rv8.io/isa.html.


This report presents a Verilog hardware description language implementation of a 16
point Discrete Fourier transform using the Fast Fourier Transform (radix-2) algorithm and
the CORDIC algorithm, with 16 bit precision. Simulations were performed in Xilinx ISE and
Xilinx Vivado. Results show that the relative mean square error in the implementation with
respect to corresponding FFT computations in MATLABÂ® are less than 2%.
